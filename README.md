# Solid Wordle - Solidle

This is a clone project of [React Wordle](https://github.com/cwackerfuss/react-wordle), which is also a clone project of the popular word guessing game we all know and love. Made using [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/), Typescript, and Tailwind.

## Build and run

### To Run Locally:

Make sure you have installed `yarn: ^1.0.0`. Clone the repository and perform the following command line actions:

```bash
$> cd solid-wordle
$> yarn
$> yarn dev
```

## P/S

This project was highly inspired by [React Wordle](https://github.com/cwackerfuss/react-wordle), just my try on Solid. Tho I know Solid and React share maybe 80% of their syntaxes, I was super amazed by how fast and easy to migrate React codes to Solid ones.
If you're a React developer, learning Solid won't be that long for sure. Give Solid a shot!
